# Solution Design Phase

## Purpose
The purpose of the "Solution Design" phase is to create a robust, scalable, and secure architecture for the Master Data Management (MDM) system, specifically tailored to the needs of a large retail bank. This phase focuses on consolidating various data sources into a single MDM platform hosted on AWS, ensuring high availability, security, and compliance with banking regulations.

## Key Activities

### 1. Choose MDM Model
Select the most appropriate MDM model to support the bank's need for a unified master data management approach.

#### Actions:
- **Consolidation Model:** Opt for a consolidation model where data from various sources is aggregated into a central MDM hub, providing a single source of truth for all master data.
- **Evaluate Data Sources:** Identify all current data sources that need to be integrated, such as customer information systems, transaction processing systems, and external data services.

### 2. Architecture Design
Develop a detailed technical architecture using AWS services to support the MDM solution.

#### Actions:
- **AWS Services Utilization:**
  - **Amazon S3:** Use S3 for scalable and secure data storage.
  - **Amazon RDS/Aurora:** Deploy RDS or Aurora for managed database solutions to handle transactional data.
  - **AWS Glue:** Utilize Glue for data integration and ETL processes.
  - **AWS Lambda:** Implement Lambda for serverless computing to handle data processing and business logic.
- **High Availability Design:** Design the architecture to be fault-tolerant and highly available across multiple AWS regions.

### 3. Security and Compliance
Ensure the design meets the strict security and regulatory requirements specific to the banking industry.

#### Actions:
- **Data Encryption:** Implement encryption at rest and in transit using AWS KMS (Key Management Service).
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Use IAM to manage access controls strictly.
- **Compliance Audits:** Design the solution to comply with financial regulations such as GDPR and PCI-DSS, utilizing AWSâ€™s compliance capabilities.

### 4. Prototype Development
Develop a prototype of the MDM solution to validate the architecture and integration points.

#### Actions:
- **Build Prototype:** Create a small-scale version of the proposed solution using the selected AWS services.
- **Testing and Feedback:** Test the prototype with sample data and gather feedback from key stakeholders to refine the approach.

## Teams Involved
- **IT Architects:** Lead the design and specification of the MDM solution.
- **System Integrators:** Assist with the integration of AWS services and other banking systems.
- **Security Team:** Ensure the solution design complies with all relevant security standards and regulations.

## Output/Deliverable
- **MDM Technical Architecture Document:** A comprehensive document detailing the chosen MDM model, AWS service configurations, security measures, and compliance alignment. This document serves as the blueprint for implementing the MDM solution.

## Importance of This Phase
The Solution Design phase is crucial as it lays down the technical foundation for the MDM system. By carefully designing a solution that leverages the capabilities of AWS, the bank can ensure that its master data is managed effectively, securely, and in compliance with all regulatory requirements, thereby supporting better customer service and more informed decision-making.
