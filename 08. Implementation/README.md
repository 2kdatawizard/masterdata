# System Development and Integration Phase

## Purpose
The purpose of the "System Development and Integration" phase is to effectively develop, configure, and integrate the chosen Informatica MDM software within the existing IT infrastructure, and to implement robust data quality improvement processes.

## Key Activities

### 1. Install and Configure MDM Software
- **Objective**: Successfully install Informatica MDM and configure it to meet the specific needs of our organization.
- **Steps**:
  - **Installation**: Deploy Informatica MDM on the designated AWS infrastructure ensuring all system prerequisites are met.
  - **Configuration**:
    - Set up the core modules of Informatica MDM including the data director, data models, and user interfaces.
    - Configure integration services to enable seamless data flow between existing systems and the MDM platform.
    - Establish security settings that align with the organization's data security policies, including role-based access controls.
- **Testing**:
  - Perform initial configuration tests to ensure the software is correctly installed and the basic setups are functioning as intended.

### 2. Develop Integration with Existing Systems
- **Objective**: Ensure that Informatica MDM is fully integrated with existing enterprise applications and data sources to enable a unified master data management approach.
- **Steps**:
  - **Identify Integration Points**:
    - Map out critical integration points with systems like CRM, ERP, and external data services.
    - Define data flows and synchronization points between these systems and Informatica MDM.
  - **Develop Integration Solutions**:
    - Utilize Talend to create ETL processes that cleanse, transform, and load data into Informatica MDM.
    - Use API management tools like Amazon API Gateway to facilitate secure and efficient data exchange.
  - **Integration Testing**:
    - Conduct extensive integration testing to validate data flows and functional interactions between systems.
    - Document all integration test results for review and compliance purposes.

### 3. Implement Data Quality Improvement Processes
- **Objective**: Establish and maintain high data quality standards within the MDM system.
- **Steps**:
  - **Define Data Quality Rules**:
    - Collaborate with data stewards to define comprehensive data quality rules based on the organization’s data governance policies.
    - Configure these rules within Informatica MDM to automate data cleansing and validation processes.
  - **Implement Continuous Data Quality Monitoring**:
    - Set up monitoring tools within Informatica MDM to continuously assess data quality.
    - Integrate feedback mechanisms to ensure ongoing improvement and refinement of data quality processes.

## Key Deliverables
- **Operational MDM System**:
  - A fully functional MDM system that integrates seamlessly with existing systems, manages data efficiently, and upholds the organization’s data quality standards.
- **Integration Test Reports**:
  - Detailed reports documenting the outcomes of integration tests, highlighting successes and areas for improvement to ensure continuous system optimization.

## Conclusion
The "System Development and Integration" phase is critical in ensuring that the Informatica MDM software is not only technically sound but also fully integrated and aligned with the organization’s data management needs. By carefully planning and executing this phase, the project team can ensure that the MDM system will serve as a robust foundation for managing master data across the enterprise.


# Useful Diagrams for System Development and Integration Phase

Including diagrams in the documentation can significantly enhance understanding and provide visual clarity on complex processes and system integrations. Here are several diagrams that are particularly useful for the System Development and Integration phase of an MDM project:

## 1. System Architecture Diagram
- **Purpose**: Visualizes the overall architecture of the MDM system within the existing IT infrastructure.
- **Details**: Shows how Informatica MDM interfaces with other enterprise systems like ERP, CRM, and external databases, highlighting major components and data flow paths.

## 2. Integration Flowchart
- **Purpose**: Illustrates the detailed data flow and integration processes between Informatica MDM and other systems.
- **Details**: Includes ETL processes, API integrations, and synchronization points, showcasing how data is extracted, transformed, and loaded across systems.

## 3. Data Quality Management Workflow
- **Purpose**: Depicts the workflow for managing and improving data quality within the MDM system.
- **Details**: Outlines steps from data ingestion, quality rule application, error handling, and continuous quality monitoring.

## 4. Security Configuration Diagram
- **Purpose**: Shows the security mechanisms implemented within the MDM system.
- **Details**: Details the configuration of role-based access controls, data encryption, and secure data exchange protocols.

## 5. Installation and Configuration Checklist
- **Purpose**: Provides a visual checklist of key installation and configuration steps for Informatica MDM.
- **Details**: Lists each major step with indicators for completion, verification points, and dependencies.

## 6. Gantt Chart of Implementation Timeline
- **Purpose**: Offers a timeline view of the entire implementation phase, including milestones and dependencies.
- **Details**: Visual representation of project phases, duration of each activity, overlapping activities, and critical paths.

## 7. Test Plan and Results Diagram
- **Purpose**: Visualizes the testing strategy, including integration and data quality testing phases.
- **Details**: Shows test scenarios, methods employed, testing schedule, and highlights results or discrepancies found during testing.

Each of these diagrams will aid in conveying complex information in a digestible format, enhancing stakeholder understanding and engagement with the project details. They should be included in both internal project documentation
