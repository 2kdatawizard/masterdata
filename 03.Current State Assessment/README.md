# Current State Assessment Phase

## Purpose
The purpose of the "Current State Assessment" phase is to evaluate the existing data management environment. This assessment helps identify the current data flows, data quality issues, system redundancies, and any gaps in data governance that the MDM project needs to address.

## Key Activities

### 1. Audit Existing Data Systems
Thoroughly examine the current data storage systems, databases, and other data management tools to understand the architecture, data flow, and interdependencies.

#### Actions:
- **Data Inventory:** Create an inventory of all data assets, including databases, data warehouses, and cloud storage solutions.
- **System Mapping:** Map out the relationships and data flows between existing systems to identify dependencies and potential bottlenecks.

### 2. Assess Data Quality
Evaluate the quality of the data across systems to identify issues with accuracy, completeness, consistency, and timeliness.

#### Actions:
- **Quality Metrics:** Define and measure data quality metrics such as accuracy, completeness, and uniqueness.
- **Data Profiling:** Conduct data profiling to analyze the actual content, structure, and quality of the data stored in different systems.

### 3. Review Data Governance Practices
Review the current data governance framework to assess its effectiveness and identify areas needing improvement for MDM success.

#### Actions:
- **Governance Framework Review:** Analyze the existing data governance policies, standards, and procedures.
- **Stakeholder Interviews:** Interview key data stakeholders to understand their perspective on data governance effectiveness and challenges.

## Teams Involved
- **Data Analysts:** Responsible for performing data quality assessments and data profiling.
- **IT Support:** Involved in providing details about the existing IT infrastructure and systems.
- **Data Governance Team:** Assesses current governance practices and provides insights into necessary improvements.

## Output/Deliverable
- **Assessment Report:** A comprehensive document that includes:
  - An inventory of current data assets and their interdependencies.
  - A report on data quality issues and recommendations for improvement.
  - An evaluation of the existing data governance practices with suggestions for the MDM strategy.

## Importance of This Phase
This phase is crucial as it provides a clear understanding of the starting point for the MDM initiative. By assessing the current state, the organization can make informed decisions about necessary investments in technology, processes, and governance to meet the desired data management goals. This assessment also helps in setting realistic expectations for the MDM project by providing a baseline against which progress can be measured.
