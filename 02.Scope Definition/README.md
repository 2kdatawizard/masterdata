# Scope Definition Phase

## Purpose
The "Scope Definition" phase aims to clearly define the boundaries and focus of the Master Data Management (MDM) project, specifying which data domains, systems, and processes will be involved.

## Key Activities

### 1. Determining Data Domains Covered
Identify and select the critical data domains that will be managed through the MDM system. Common data domains include customer, product, supplier, and asset data. The selection depends on the business priorities and areas most impacted by data issues.

#### Actions:
- **Workshops with Business Units:** Conduct sessions to understand the key data domains that influence business operations.
- **Impact Analysis:** Assess how these data domains affect various business processes and decision-making.

### 2. Scope Technical Requirements
Define the technical scope, including system requirements, data integration needs, and any specific compliance or security considerations.

#### Actions:
- **System Requirements Specification:** Develop detailed specifications that outline the necessary system features and capabilities.
- **Integration Architecture Planning:** Plan how different data sources will be integrated into the MDM system.
- **Security and Compliance Assessment:** Ensure that the MDM system adheres to relevant data security standards and regulatory requirements.

## Teams Involved
- **Data Governance Team:** Guides the selection of data domains and ensures alignment with data governance policies.
- **IT Architects:** Responsible for the technical scoping, including system design and integration planning.

## Output/Deliverable
- **Scoped MDM Requirements:** A document that outlines the chosen data domains, technical specifications, and integration plans. This document ensures that all project stakeholders have a clear understanding of the project scope and technical direction.

## Importance of This Phase
Defining the scope is critical to the success of the MDM project as it sets clear expectations and limits. It helps prevent scope creep and ensures that resources are allocated efficiently to areas of highest business impact. This phase also establishes the foundation for subsequent phases, particularly Solution Design and Technology Selection.
