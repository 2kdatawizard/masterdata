# Implementation Planning Phase

## Purpose
The purpose of the "Implementation Planning" phase is to prepare a detailed blueprint for the execution of the MDM project. This includes developing a comprehensive project timeline, defining milestones, and outlining the resources and budget needed for successful implementation.

### Gantt Chart
To visualize the project timeline and milestones, a Gantt chart should be developed using project management tools like Microsoft Project or similar.

## 2. Resource and Budget Allocation Plan

### Resource Allocation
The MDM project will require a mix of internal resources and external consultants. Key resource allocations include:
- **Project Manager:** Oversee the project from initiation to closure.
- **Data Architects:** Design the MDM architecture.
- **System Developers:** Responsible for MDM system development.
- **Data Analysts:** Involved in the data quality and integration tasks.
- **Quality Assurance Team:** Handle all testing phases.
- **Training Specialists:** Develop and deliver training materials.

### Budget Allocation
The total estimated budget for the MDM project is $2.5 million, broken down as follows:

| Expense Category      | Allocation    | Details                                               |
|-----------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Personnel             | $1.2 Million  | Salaries for project team members and external consultants. |
| Software Licenses     | $600,000      | Costs for MDM software and other supporting software licenses. |
| Hardware and Hosting  | $300,000      | Servers, storage, and cloud hosting expenses.         |
| Training and Travel   | $150,000      | Training sessions and necessary travel expenses.      |
| Contingency           | $250,000      | Reserved for unexpected expenses.                     |

### Budget Justification
Each category has been carefully considered to ensure sufficient funding is available to cover all aspects of the MDM implementation. Contingency funds are allocated to manage risks associated with unforeseen challenges.

## Conclusion
The detailed project plan with clearly defined timelines, milestones, resource allocations, and a well-justified budget lays the foundation for the successful implementation of the MDM project. Regular reviews and updates to the plan will be essential to adapt to any changes and ensure the project stays on track.
