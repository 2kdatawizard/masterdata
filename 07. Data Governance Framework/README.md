# Data Governance Framework Phase

## Purpose
The purpose of the "Data Governance Framework" phase is to establish a comprehensive set of policies, procedures, and roles that will govern the management of master data across its lifecycle. This framework ensures data quality, security, compliance, and effective use of data within the organization.

## 1. Data Governance Policies and Procedures

### Key Policies
To ensure effective management and use of MDM data, the following key policies are implemented:

#### Data Quality Policy
- **Objective:** Ensure the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and reliability of master data.
- **Procedure:** Implement regular data quality checks and audits. Utilize automated data cleansing and enrichment tools to maintain data quality.

#### Data Security and Privacy Policy
- **Objective:** Protect master data from unauthorized access and ensure compliance with relevant data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
- **Procedure:** Enforce data encryption, access controls, and regular security audits. Conduct privacy impact assessments for new data processing activities.

#### Data Retention and Archival Policy
- **Objective:** Define how long different types of master data are retained and how they are safely archived or deleted.
- **Procedure:** Establish data retention schedules based on legal and business requirements. Use secure methods for data deletion and archival.

#### Data Access and Usage Policy
- **Objective:** Regulate who can access and use the master data in the organization.
- **Procedure:** Define access levels and permissions based on roles. Maintain logs of data access and usage for audit purposes.

### Governance Procedures
- **Change Management:** Define a process for managing changes to the MDM system, including data models and integration points.
- **Incident Management:** Establish protocols for responding to data-related incidents, including data breaches and data quality issues.

## 2. Data Stewardship Processes and Ownership Roles

### Data Stewardship
Data Stewardship is crucial for ensuring the policies are applied and the data's integrity is maintained throughout its lifecycle.

#### Roles
- **Chief Data Officer (CDO):** Responsible for the overall management of data governance strategies.
- **Data Stewards:** Assigned for specific data domains (e.g., customer data, product data), responsible for overseeing data quality, compliance, and usage.
- **Data Custodians:** IT personnel responsible for the technical management of data storage, security, and access.

#### Processes
- **Data Quality Management:** Regular reviews and audits by data stewards to ensure compliance with the data quality policy.
- **Data Security Management:** Coordination between data stewards and IT security teams to implement the data security policy.

## 3. Detailed Data Governance Framework

### Framework Components
- **Governance Structure:** Establish a Data Governance Committee led by the CDO, including representatives from business, IT, and legal to oversee data governance.
- **Governance Activities:**
  - **Regular Meetings:** Schedule quarterly meetings to review policies, discuss issues, and update procedures as necessary.
  - **Reporting and Metrics:** Develop metrics to measure compliance with data governance policies and the effectiveness of data stewardship.
  - **Training and Awareness:** Conduct regular training sessions for employees on data governance practices and the importance of data compliance.

### Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1:** Rollout of the Data Governance Framework to critical data domains with training and communication plans.
- **Phase 2:** Extend governance practices to all data domains and integrate feedback from initial phases to refine governance processes.

### Monitoring and Compliance
- **Tools and Technologies:** Utilize data governance software to monitor compliance, manage data quality, and track data lineage.
- **Audit and Compliance Checks:** Regular internal and external audits to ensure adherence to governance policies and procedures.

## Conclusion
Implementing a detailed Data Governance Framework is essential for the effective management of master data within the MDM system. By establishing clear policies, roles, and procedures, the organization can ensure data integrity, security, and compliance, supporting its strategic objectives and operational efficiency.

# Data Governance Framework Diagrams

Below is a list of diagrams that are useful for illustrating various aspects of data governance within an MDM project.
